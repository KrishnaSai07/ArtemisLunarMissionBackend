1;Surface Info;The moon's surface is covered with dead volcanoes, impact craters, and lava flows, some visible to the unaided stargazer;Public;Leonard Hofstader;leonard.Hofstader@gmail.com;moonSurface.jpg;2021-05-09 12:33:45
2;Orbital Info;With a mean orbital velocity of 1.022 km/s (0.635 miles/s), the Moon covers a distance approximately its diameter, or about half a degree on the celestial sphere, each hour;Public;Leonard Hofstader;leonard.Hofstader@gmail.com;moonOrbital.jpg;2021-05-19 09:33:45
3;Dark side of the moon;The 'dark side' of the Moon refers to the hemisphere of the Moon that is facing away from the Earth. In reality it is no darker than any other part of the Moon's surface as sunlight does in fact fall equally on all sides of the Moon.;Public;Leonard Hofstader;leonard.Hofstader@gmail.com;darkSurface.jpg;2021-10-02 07:19:22
4;Water on the moon;Lunar water is water that is present on the Moon. It was first discovered by ISRO through its Chandrayaan mission. Diffuse water molecules can persist at the Moon's sunlit surface, as discovered by NASA's SOFIA observatory in 2020.;Private;Leonard Hofstader;leonard.Hofstader@gmail.com;waterMoonSurface.jpg;2021-10-02 14:17:10
5;Atmosphere on Moon;On the moon, there's no air to breathe, no breezes to make the flags planted there by the Apollo astronauts flutter. However, there is a very, very thin layer of gases on the lunar surface that can almost be called an atmosphere. Technically, it's considered an exosphere.;Public;Leonard Hofstader;leonard.Hofstader@gmail.com;moonAtmosphere.jpg;2021-10-02 13:05:01
6;Moon affecting ocean currents;Tidal currents, just like tides, are affected by the different phases of the moon. When the moon is at full or new phases, tidal current velocities are strong and are called “spring currents.” When the moon is at first or third quarter phases, tidal current velocities are weak and are called “neap currents.”;Private;Sheldon Cooper;sheldon.cooper@gmail.com;oceanCurrents.jpg;2021-10-02 20:06:37
7;Moon Rotation;The moon orbits the Earth once every 27.322 days. It also takes approximately 27 days for the moon to rotate once on its axis. As a result, the moon does not seem to be spinning but appears to observers from Earth to be keeping almost perfectly still. Scientists call this synchronous rotation.;Private;Rajesh Koothrapalli;rajesh.koothrapalli@gmail.com;moonRotation.jpg;2021-10-02 20:20:05
